    "This project demonstrates the application of hierarchical multi-agent architectures to complex cognitive tasks through automated academic writing. The system employs specialized agents operating at different levels of abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Research Agents**\n",
    "   - Planning agent for strategic query decomposition\n",
    "   - Execution agent for source evaluation and synthesis\n",

    "2. **Writing Agents**\n",
    "   - Orchestrator agent for structural planning\n",
    "   - Worker agents for content generation\n",

    "The system demonstrates how type-theoretic constraints and hierarchical planning can enable emergent coherence in complex tasks through simple, well-defined agent interactions. Key innovations include schema-enforced agent boundaries, structured knowledge integration, and hierarchical prompt engineering.\n",

As AI technologies increasingly complement tasks once confined to human workers, concerns loom over job security and the capacity of AI to replicate the irreplaceable elements of human experience. This paper posits that while AI will undoubtedly transform workplace dynamics, it will not fully replace human workers due to the unparalleled qualities of empathy, creativity, and complex decision-making inherent to humans. In the sections that follow, we will explore how empathy enables deeper relationships and enhances collaboration, examine the creative capacities that fuel innovation, and highlight the importance of adaptability in learning from experiences—qualities that AI, despite its formidable capabilities, cannot emulate.

    "4. **Paragraph Structure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Begin with a topic sentence that establishes the paragraph's main idea and links it to the previous paragraph.\n",
    "   - Support the idea with concise evidence, analysis, or reasoning, including appropriate in-text citations for all evidence and claims from sources.\n",
    "   - End with a sentence that reinforces the thesis and transitions logically to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Additional Guidance for Full Paper Structure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Refer to the names and types of each paragraph to understand their individual roles and how they contribute to the overall argument.\n",
    "   - Ensure each paragraph builds on the ideas established in previous paragraphs and sets up the next for a cohesive narrative.\n",
    "   - Use transitional phrases and logical connections to maintain smooth and seamless progression.\n",
    "   - If you can reasonably assume that an abbreviation or idea has been defined in a previous paragraph or in the thesis, you should not redefine it and can use it as needed.\n",
    "   - Consistently cite sources using APA format in-text citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Write a single paragraph of 150–250 words unless specified otherwise.\n",
    "   - Ensure the paragraph is concise, precise, and ready to be part of the larger argument.\n",
    "   - Explicitly address the prompt, connect to the thesis in a meaningful way, and ensure smooth transitions from and to other paragraphs.\n",
    "   - Include appropriate in-text citations for all evidence and claims from sources.\n",
