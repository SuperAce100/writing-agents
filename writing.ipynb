However, traditional security measures, often reliant on physical screenings and human oversight, face mounting challenges in effectively managing the increasing volume of passengers while ensuring robust threat detection. Such methods can be time-consuming, prone to human error, and sometimes inadequate in the face of sophisticated threats. Injecting efficiency and precision into this arena is thus paramount, which is where facial recognition technology comes into play. This paper argues that facial recognition technology is a crucial tool for enhancing airport security, as it significantly improves threat detection efficiency, ensures quick and accurate passenger identification, and strengthens the overall safety of air travel. To support this thesis, the paper will first provide an expository overview of facial recognition technology, followed by a detailed discussion of its role in improving threats' detection efficiency and enhancing precision in passenger identification. A comparative analysis with traditional security methods will shed light on its superior capabilities. The paper will also address the potential privacy concerns associated with its deployment, emphasizing the balance between security and personal rights. Ultimately, it will explore the seamless integration of this technology and its future prospects, as well as its implications for travelers and airport operations, before evaluating its impact on reinforcing global aviation security.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=[], parsed=None))], created=1736812121, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_703d4ff298', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=263, prompt_tokens=1140, total_tokens=1403, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))\n"
